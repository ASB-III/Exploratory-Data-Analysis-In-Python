    "# Introduction\n",
    "When we want to understand underlying groups for a set of observations but don’t know what the group labels should be, we often turn to unsupervised clustering. If we are planning to fit an unsupervised machine learning model, we often want to explore questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How many groups are there?\n",
    "How might those groups differ?\n",
    "In this article, we will demonstrate an exploratory process for beginning to address these questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data\n",
    "Let’s say that you are opening a restaurant and want to be sure to offer a “wide variety” of wines. You get this dataset of chemical differences between types of wines from the UCI Machine Learning Repository with traits such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alcohol\n",
    "- Malic acid\n",
    "- Ash\n",
    "- Alcalinity of ash\n",
    "- Magnesium\n",
    "- Total phenols\n",
    "- Flavanoids\n",
    "- Nonflavanoid phenols\n",
    "- Proanthocyanins\n",
    "- Color intensity\n",
    "- Hue\n",
    "- OD280/OD315 of diluted wines\n",
    "- Proline\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to use this information to try to categorize the wine into different groups to ensure that the wines that you decide to buy for the restaurant have a good amount of variety. You want the wines within each group to be similar to each other, and wines in different groups to be less similar. You have no idea how many groups there are or what the group labels should be. So instead, you want to see if the given information has natural groupings based on the characteristics that you have collected data about.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get started, you might need to answer some of the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- How many different kinds of wine are there?\n",
    "- How do those wine types differ?\n",
    "For some unsupervised clustering algorithms, you’ll need to specify the number of groups ahead of time. Also, different types of algorithms can handle different kinds of groupings more efficiently, so it can be helpful to visualize the shapes of the clusters. For example, k-means algorithms are good at identifying data groups with spherical shapes because they are based on principles of equal variance and distance between data points:"
