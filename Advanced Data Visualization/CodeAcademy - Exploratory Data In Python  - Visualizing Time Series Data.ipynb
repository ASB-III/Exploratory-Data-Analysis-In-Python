    "Data represented in a single point in time is known as cross-sectional data. As a data scientist or analyst, sometimes you might encounter data that is collected over periods of time, known as time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series data shows up in the real world quite often. For example, weather readings, company stock prices, and sales data are all examples of data that can be tracked over time. Therefore, it’s important that you are able to explore and visualize data with a time component.\n",

    "\n",
    "In a line plot, time is usually on the x-axis and the observation values are on the y-axis. Let’s show an example of this plot using sales data for a small business over a five-year period.\n",

    "- If the points move from the top left to the bottom right, this indicates a negative correlation between observations and their lag 1 values. For example, high sales on one day are associated with low sales on the previous day and vice versa.\n",
    "- If there is no identifiable structure in the lag plot, this indicates the data is random, and there is no association between values at consecutive time points. For example, sales on one day tell you no information about expected sales on the following day.\n",
    "Exploring the relationship between an observation and a lag of that observation is useful for helping us determine whether a dataset is random.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the points in the sales data move along a diagonal line from the bottom left to the top right, this indicates that our data is not random and there is a positive correlation between observations and their lag 1 values.\n",

    "In the autocorrelation plot above, lag is on the x-axis and the value of the autocorrelation, which ranges from -1 to 1, is on the y-axis. A value near 0 indicates a weak correlation while values closer to -1 and 1 indicate a strong correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice how the autocorrelation plot for the sales data forms waves, oscillating between strong negative and positive correlation. These waves suggest that our dataset exhibits seasonality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, notice how the autocorrelation decreases over time. This indicates that sales tend to be similar on consecutive days, but sales from three years ago are less associated with today’s sales than sales from one year ago.\n",
