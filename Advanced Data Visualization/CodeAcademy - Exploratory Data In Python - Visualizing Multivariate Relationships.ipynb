    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Exploring multivariate relationships is an important skill to have as a data analyst or scientist. You might be familiar with univariate (one variable) and bivariate (two variables) analysis. However, datasets often contain more than two features, so it’s important to be able to explore and visualize multiple variables at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, you will learn how to visualize multivariate relationships using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scatter plots with visual cues\n",
    "- Grouped box plots\n",
    "- Multi-dimensional plots\n",
    "Let’s get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scatter plots with visual cues\n",
    "One way to represent multivariate relationships is to use visual cues such as colors, shapes, and sizes in a scatter plot. Let’s demonstrate an example using life expectancy data from the World Health Organization.\n",

    "This multivariate visualization provides much more insight than the bivariate visualization above. For example, we can see that:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Years of education and life expectancy have a positive relationship\n",
    "- Individuals in developed countries have more years of schooling than individuals in developing countries\n",
    "- The life expectancy in developed countries is greater than the life expectancy in developing countries\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though it’s possible to add more variables using additional visual cues, it’s not always a great idea to do so. For example, let’s try adding a fourth variable to this visualization using shapes as a visual cue:"

    "\n",
    "## Grouped box plots\n",
    "Grouped box plots can be used to visualize two categorical variables and a quantitative variable. Having the box plots side-by-side can help you gain useful insights.\n",

    "Notice how there are now three axes instead of two, allowing you to see your data in a new dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "3D plots allow you to see relationships that might not be visible in 2D, such as clusters. Interactive graphing libraries such as Plotly allow you to rotate the plot to see points from different angles and zoom into specific areas of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The downside of 3D plots is that they can be difficult to read in two dimensions. That means that if you need to write a paper report, a 3D plot might not be the best idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Review\n",
    "Datasets often contain many features, which we can use in a model to make predictions or run an analysis. Therefore, it’s important to be able to understand and visualize multiple relationships at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, you learned how to represent multivariate data using:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scatter plots with visual cues\n",
    "- Grouped box plots\n",
    "- Multi-dimensional plots\n",
    "You are now better equipped to create more meaningful visualizations and to think beyond just simple univariate and bivariate terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, it’s also important to recognize that adding too much to a single visualization makes it more difficult to understand relationships, so there’s a limit to what we can explore all at once."
