    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Data visualization is an important component of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) because it allows a data analyst to “look at” their data and get to know the variables and relationships between them. In order to choose and design a data visualization, it is important to consider two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The question you want to answer (and how many variables that question involves)\n",
    "- The data that is available (is it quantitative or categorical?)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this article, we’ll use data visualization to explore a dataset from StreetEasy, which contains information about housing rentals in New York City. The first few rows of the dataset are printed below (note that we have subsetted the original data for the purposes of this article):"

    "- What is the typical price of a rental in New York City?\n",

    "Box plots (or violin plots) and histograms are common choices for visually summarizing a quantitative variable. These plots are useful because they simultaneously communicate information about minimum and maximum values, central location, and spread. Histograms can additionally illuminate patterns that can impact an analysis (eg., skew or multimodality).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we are interested in learning more about the price of apartments in NYC. A good starting place is to plot a box plot of the rent variable. We could plot a boxplot of rent as follows:"
