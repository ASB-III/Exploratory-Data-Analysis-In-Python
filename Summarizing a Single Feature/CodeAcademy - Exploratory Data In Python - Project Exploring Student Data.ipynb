    "\n",
    "address: the location of the student’s home ('U' for urban and 'R' for rural)\n",
    "absences: the number of times the student was absent during the school year\n",
    "Mjob: the student’s mother’s job industry\n",
    "Fjob: the student’s father’s job industry\n",
    "math_grade: the student’s final grade in math, ranging from 0 to 20\n",
    "Use the pandas .head() method to inspect the first few rows of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`Hint` <br>\n",
    "`Print the first five rows using print(students.head()).`\n",
